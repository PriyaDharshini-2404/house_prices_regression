# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Regression Model

This project is part of my internship at **Codveda Technologies**, where I built a Linear Regression model using Python and Scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on real estate features.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Boston Housing Dataset**, which includes information about housing in Boston suburbs. It consists of 13 numerical features and a target variable `MEDV` (Median house value in $1000s).

**Features include:**
- CRIM: Crime rate by town
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- ... and more

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Perform data loading and preprocessing
- Build and train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize predicted vs. actual values

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 21.89  
- **R-squared (R²)**: 0.6688

The model explains approximately 66.88% of the variance in housing prices based on the selected features.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Actual vs. Predicted Prices (Scatter Plot)
- Histogram of feature distributions
- Heatmap of feature correlations

These visualizations help understand the relationship between input features and the target variable.
